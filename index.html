			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hi! I'm Dorothy. I am a civic-minded product manager. I'm on a mission to create tech products that solve city problems and that empower residents to take an active role in their communities. I believe that modern technology is the key to helping our communities better address the local challenges we face as Torontonians - like rising unemployment, increasing transit congestion, the depleting city tree canopy...just to name a few. 

			When I'm not  You'll often find me baking pies or riding my bicycle around Toronto. Sometimes I dream of Dim Sum.
